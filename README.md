# Covid-19 Food Providing & Voluntary services

### Project Description
In this pandemic situation, it is important to address the hunger needs of COVID positive or recovering patients, health workers, and economically backward people who do not have access to essential resources and food. We should reach out to the ones in need in these tough times. We propose a provision of voluntary services (completely free of cost) delivered at their doorstep.
